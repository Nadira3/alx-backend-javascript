## Introduction
This directory contains tasks related to the basics of ECMAScript 6 (ES6), the version of JavaScript that introduces new syntax and features to the language. These tasks are part of the ALX Software Engineering curriculum and focus on improving understanding of modern JavaScript features.

## Learning Objectives
By completing the exercises in this directory, you should be able to:

- Understand the benefits of ES6 syntax and features.
- Use `const` and `let` to define variables.
- Work with arrow functions.
- Implement template literals.
- Understand block-scoped variables.
- Use default function parameters.
- Work with the rest and spread operators.
- Utilize string interpolation and enhanced object literals.

| `0-constant.js`         | Script that demonstrates the use of `const` to define a constant variable.  |
| `1-block-scoped.js`     | Script that shows the difference between `var` and `let` in block scope.    |
| `2-arrow.js`            | Introduction to arrow functions and their concise syntax.                   |
| `3-default-parameter.js`| Demonstrates the use of default parameters in ES6 functions.                |
| `4-rest-parameter.js`   | Explains how to use rest parameters in functions.                           |
| `5-spread-operator.js`  | Shows how to use the spread operator to combine arrays and objects.         |
| `6-template-literals.js`| Example of template literals for string interpolation.                      |
| `7-object-literals.js`  | Demonstrates enhanced object literals in ES6.                               |

## Installation

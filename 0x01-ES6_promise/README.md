# ALX 0x01-ES6_promise

This project is part of the ALX program and focuses on the implementation and understanding of ES6 Promises in JavaScript. The goal is to learn how to work with promises, handle asynchronous operations, and develop a better understanding of the Promise API.

## Project Overview

The **0x01-ES6_promise** project includes several tasks designed to reinforce the concepts related to ES6 promises. Each task builds on the previous one, providing practical experience with promise creation, resolution, rejection, and chaining.

## Features

- Creation of simple and complex promises
- Handling promise resolution and rejection
- Chaining multiple promises
- Understanding the Promise API
- Error handling with promises

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/0x01-ES6_promise.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd 0x01-ES6_promise
```

3. Open the project in your preferred code editor.



## Usage

To run the tests and see the promises in action, you can use Node.js:

1. Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from nodejs.org.


2. Run the main JavaScript file:
```
node yourfile.js
```


## Task List

1. Task 0: Create a simple promise that resolves with a value.


2. Task 1: Create a promise that rejects with an error.


3. Task 2: Chain multiple promises together.


4. Task 3: Use Promise.all to handle multiple promises.


5. Task 4: Implement error handling for promises.
